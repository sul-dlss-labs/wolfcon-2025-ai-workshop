### MCP Clients
MCP is based on a client-server architecture with a MCP 
Host that has one or more MCP clients connect one-on-one
with a MCP Server. The MCP client maintains a connection 
to the MCP Server and then provides the model context to 
the MCP Host that is forwarded to a generative AI model.
