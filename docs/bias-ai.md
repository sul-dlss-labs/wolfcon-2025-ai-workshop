### Bias and AI

<figure>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
   <p>
   AI bias, also referred to as machine learning bias or algorithm bias, refers 
   to AI systems that produce biased results that reflect and perpetuate human 
   biases within a society, including historical and current social inequality. 
   Bias can be found in the initial training data, the algorithm, or the 
   predictions the algorithm produces.

#### Sources of Bias

##### Training data
- Training data can over or under sample underrepresented groups
  
    - **Example**:
      Exclusively using copyright-free material from the 1930s and earlier 
      may under-represent many groups.
 
- Training data can also be biased in labeling by excluding or over-representing
  certain categories or characteristics.

    - **Example**
      If using a controlled vocabulary that focuses on Western categories and concepts,
      this data might miss valid indigenous concepts and constructions that may be present in the
      training data.  

##### Algorithms
- Algorithms based on biased data could perpetrate underlying flaws
    - **Example**
      If training data is taken to be relatively free of bias but bias exist in the 
      algorithms used may have allow acceptance of false statements. 
  
- Programmers could introduce personal bias intentionally or unintentionally

- Unintended consequences of using proxies for characteristics in the 
  population

    - **Example**
      Using geographic location as a proxy for income may skew analysis 

##### Cognitive
- People's experiences and preferences can introduce and favor bias or 
  weighting of outcomes or selection of data.


#### Mitigation and Responses
How can we mitigate or respond to AI and Machine Learning bias?
