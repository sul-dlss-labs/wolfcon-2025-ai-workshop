### Deepfakes
While the problem of differentiating between artificially manipulated image, 
audio, or video and "real" media has existed since at least the early-to-mid 
twentieth century[^soviet]. However, modern generative AI models and services allow for 
sophisticated generation and manipulation of images, audio, and video, commonly known
as "deepfakes" - a term that combines "deep learning" and "fakes"[^wikipedia]. 

A worrying consequences of this emerging era of widespread and cheap deepfakes 
on political discourse are being monitored by such projects as the [AI Election Project][WIRED_AI_ELECTION].

The challenge of deepfakes in politics is not restricted to any one region of the world, 
with the following examples documented by the [Election Project][WIRED_AI_ELECTION].

#### Examples of Political Deepfakes
- United States, *Fake Joe Biden robocalls*[^NBC_NEWS_JAN_24] in New Hampshire Primary, 
  *Fake image of Donald Trump with Black Voters*[^BBC_NEWS_MAR_24]

- Mexico, *Fake recording of Mexico City Mayor interfering with Elections*[^AP_NEWS_NOV_23]

- Ukraine, *Deepfake shows Ukrainian president Volodymry Zelensky dancing*[^AFP_JAN_24]

- Pakistan, *Series of deepfakes encourage election boycotts in Pakistan*[^FRANCE_24_FEB_24]

- India, *South Indian political party uses AI to resurrect dead leader to campaign*[^AL_JAZEERA_FEB_24]

- Bangladeshi, *Deepfake appears to show Bangladeshi politician dropping out of race*[^DISMISS_LAB_JAN_24]

- Taiwan, *Deepfake of US congressman appears to support Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party*[^AFP_JAN_24_02]

- South Africa, *Deepfake appears to show Eminem endorsing South African opposition party*[^AFRICA_CHECK_MAR_24]

Another significant concern is the proliferation of exploitative content, including non-consensual 
sexual deepfakes involving celebrities and, alarmingly, the creation of child pornography.

#### How can Libraries help?
Libraries are adapting their information literacy programs to include new methods for evaluating sources. 
By teaching patrons how to assess and verify content found online, libraries can help them determine the 
legitimacy of what patrons encounter when consuming media.

### AI Slop
AI Slop is a term that describes the anti-pattern of publishing or disseminating 
content that has been created by Large Language Models (LLMs), often for unscrupulous 
purposes.

As technology writer Simon Willison describes in this blog post[^WILLISON],

<blockquote class="blockquote">
 <p>
  Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop. 
  But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask 
  for it, slop is the perfect term for it.
 </p>
</blockquote>

The ease of generating text and other media from generative AI and then publishing that 
material to the web, has resulted in a general degradation of search result quality by 
large search companies like Google[^GOOG]. This contributes to what Cory Doctorow calls the "enshitification"[^ENSHITIFICATION] 
of the internet, where companies, in their pursuit of profit, reduce the quality of their services. 
Large companies often lack the incentive to improve their products or even maintain the 
quality of their products. Om Malik makes the further point that although AI Slop will continue to increase[^OM]:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
 <p>
 The rise of generative AI means that there will be more indistinguishable content on the 
 internet, and the only way to stand out — is by reminding people that you are human.
 </p>
</blockquote>
  

#### What can libraries do?
While not a new problem, libraries can continue to provide quality collections that, coupled 
with our traditional role as intellectual or academic gatekeepers, minimize the inclusion of 
resources of low-quality material.
