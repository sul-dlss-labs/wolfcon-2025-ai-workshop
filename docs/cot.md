### Chain-of-Thought
Another useful prompt technique is called *chain-of-thought* where you explicitly ask 
the LLM to provide the reasoning or steps the model went through to construct the output.
This can be helpful if you're confused how or why a model returns the output to your prompt.

**Example** Create a circulation report template that includes all books that have been checked
out in the past month. Please show your thinking step-by-step as you construct the report.
