### Core Concepts of AI and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating 
intelligent machines that can learn and solve problems. A key idea is that AI
is about endowing computers with the ability to reason, discover and generalize
meaning, or learn from past experience.[^ENCYBRIT]

#### Fiction versus Actual
For more than a century, we have created fictional depictions of artificial 
intelligence, be it violent like HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet in 
Terminator, logical and unemotional like Data from Star Trek the Next Generation,
or more benevolent and playful like Ian Banks Spaceship AI. 

##### Questions
- What are your favorite fictional AIs? 
- How do these fictional depictions compare to real AI?
 
#### Narrow (or Weak) AI vs. General (or Strong) AI
Narrow AI refers to AI systems designed and trained for a specific task in a narrow
domain. General AI, also referred to Artificial General Intelligence or AGI, refers to a 
hypothetical AI that would have the ability to understand, 
learn, and apply similar reasoning to situations as human intelligence. This type of 
AI would be able to perform or exceed any intellectual task that a human can.

Key differences:

1. **Scope**: Narrow AI is limited to specific domains while General AI would have broad
   capabilities across multiple domains.
1. **Adaptability**: Narrow AI has limited abilities to adapt to situations outside of
   its training while General AI would be able to adapt and learn in novel situations 
   similar to humans.
1. **Consciousness**: General AI could exhibit characteristics of machine consciousness while 
   Narrow AI does not.

Later today we look at the existential risk that AGI could pose to humanity.

#### Importance of Data
The old computer science cliché GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage out) refers to a long-standing
observation that the quality of software outputs is directly related to the quality of
the incoming data or inputs. 

For AI outputs, issues with training data include:

- Bias that reflect the prejudices from the data creators
- Insufficient amount of high-quality data
- Data privacy and security concerns

Andrew Ng, AI scientist and entrepreneur, is a strong advocate of "data-centric 
artificial intelligence", where more time is spent in curating, cleaning, and managing
data sets for use in model training and validation, especially for workflows that may
not have a large amount of data to begin with, in order to improve the outputs of 
these models.[^NG] 

#### Machine Learning 
Machine Learning is a subset of AI where algorithms learn from data without being
explicitly programmed. Two major types of Machine Learning:

- **Supervised** - training a model with labeled datasets where examples are paired 
  with labels or categories. 
- **Unsupervised** - training a model without explicit labeled responses where the model
  tries to learn the underlying structure of the data.
