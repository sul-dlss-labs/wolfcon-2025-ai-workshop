### I-Ching Exercises
The I-Ching[^WIKI] is a historical method divination that originated in China. It involves
randomly selecting a hexagram from sixty-four hexagrams that suggest responses
and course of actions based on a textual prompt. Each hexagram is made up of 6 horizontal
lines that can be either solid (yang) or broken (yin). Each hexagram is further broken down 
into two trigrams, each made up of three lines, with an upper trigram and a lower trigram. 

Beyond its use as a divination tool, the I-Ching is also a Taoist philosophical work offering insights and practical wisdom.
