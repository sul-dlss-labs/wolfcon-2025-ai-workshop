### Final Thoughts

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    The ancestors of these eyelash mites must have been independent organisms at 
    some point in the distant past. Now the mites and the humans have found a 
    modus vivendi that works so well for both of them that neither is even aware 
    of the other’s existence. If AIs are all they’re cracked up to be by their 
    most fervent believers, this seems like a possible model for where humans 
    might end up: not just subsisting, but thriving, on byproducts produced 
    and discarded in microscopic quantities as part of the routine operations 
    of infinitely smarter and more powerful AIs.

#### What I think we (libraries) role should be
With Generative AI's tendency to hallucinate statements and facts in an 
authoritative manner. As a corrective to this tendency, one promising approach 
is to provide Large Language Models (LLMs) with graph-based knowledge bases 
in hybrid AI systems that ground LLM responses with factual statements about 
the world. With libraries, museums, archives, and other cultural heritage 
organizations increasingly representing their collections as graphs using 
ontologies such as BIBFRAME, we have an opportunity to serve as authoritative 
sources by offering shared knowledge bases about our cultures and world.

**Radical Question**: Could Libraries (and other cultural heritage organization) provide 
aligment guidence for LLMs?


#### ai4lam Metadata Working Group Plug
The ai4lam Metadata Working Group meets every second Tuesday of the Month at 8 AM California, 11 AM Washington DC,
4 PM UK, and 5 PM Oslo & Paris at the following zoom link:

https://stanford.zoom.us/j/91421044393?pwd=L0VLbnQ0WlE4SDV0MDY5SUhTQnVydz09

With myself and the other co-chair [Erik Radio](erik.radio@colorado.edu) both at FOLIO institutions,
our focus tends to be on using Generative AI with FOLIO and we encourage anyone interested to join us!

#### **Open Question**: Would there be interest in starting the process for a formal FOLIO SIG focusing on AI?
