### Final Thoughts

    The ancestors of these eyelash mites must have been independent organisms at 
    some point in the distant past. Now the mites and the humans have found a 
    modus vivendi that works so well for both of them that neither is even aware 
    of the other’s existence. If AIs are all they’re cracked up to be by their 
    most fervent believers, this seems like a possible model for where humans 
    might end up: not just subsisting, but thriving, on byproducts produced 
    and discarded in microscopic quantities as part of the routine operations 
    of infinitely smarter and more powerful AIs.
