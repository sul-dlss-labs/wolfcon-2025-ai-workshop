### MCP Servers
The Model Context Protocol Servers are programs that run either
locally or remotely and expose specific functionality through
tools, resources, and pre-built instruction templates or prompts.

- MCP Server tools provide functions that the LLMs can call based on
  the user interactions. 
- MCP Resources are typically read-only access to information that 
  enrich the context that is provided to the model such as file context,
  API documentation or database schemas.
- MCP Prompts are provided to help the model to use the tools and 
  resources.
