### Zero Shot
In a Zero-Shot prompt, ask the LLM to perform a task that the LLM has not been explicitly 
trained on. The resulting output is dependent on the LLM general knowledge and understanding 
based on its training data. 

**Example**: Please translate this sentence into Spanish, "The 2024 Summer Olympics are being
held in France".

The LLM likely hasn't been trained on translating this exact sentence but uses its general 
understanding and translation patterns to provide a response.
