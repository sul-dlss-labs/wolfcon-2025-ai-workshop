### AI Agents

AI agents are software programs or systems that use generative AI models or other AI models
to reason and initiate actions or tasks, usually on behalf of users, towards one or more goals. 
AI  agents can coordinate work with other AI agents for complex workflows.

Google[^GOOG] lists the following key features of AI agents:

- **Reasoning**: Can draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems.
- **Acting**: Can act or perform tasks based on decisions and interact with their environment.
- **Observing**: Gather information about the agent's environment.
- **Planning**: Agents with planning capabilities identify steps and evaluate potential next steps towards it's goals.
- **Collaborating**: Works with humans or other AI agents towards common goals.
- **Self-refining**: Advanced agents can self-improve using machine learning, algorithmic optimization, or
  other forms of self-modification.
